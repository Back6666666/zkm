# mips-circuits

This is a proof of concept (PoC) for zkmips implemented using the Cannon simulator, Zokrates DSL, and Groth16. It supports the full execution of Minigeth, outputs the entire instruction sequence, generates proofs for each instruction, and submits them to an on-chain contract for verification.
